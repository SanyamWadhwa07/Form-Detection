# Form Detection

## Overview
**Form Detection** is an AI-powered application that utilizes **MediaPipe** and **computer vision** techniques to analyze and provide real-time feedback on exercise posture and form. The system helps users maintain correct posture during workouts, reducing the risk of injuries and improving training efficiency.

## Features
- **Real-time exercise form detection** using **MediaPipe**
- Provides **instant feedback** on user posture and movement
- Uses **computer vision** to track body key points and angles
- **Lightweight and efficient** implementation for seamless performance
- Designed for **fitness enthusiasts** and **athletes** to optimize workouts

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)
- **MediaPipe** for pose estimation
- **TensorFlow.js** (if required for AI-based enhancements)
- **Express.js** for backend processing (if applicable)

### Install Required Packages
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```sh
npm install express mediapipe tensorflowjs
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SanyamWadhwa07/Form-Detection.git
   cd Form-Detection
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
